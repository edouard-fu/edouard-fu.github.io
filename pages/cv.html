				<h3>Training</h3>
				<p>
					In 2015, I started my bachelors in Medicine. 
					I was quickly inspired how research shapes clinical practice. 
					During my bachelors, I started investing extra hours on research at the Clinical Epidemiology Department of the LUMC, to investiage the effectiveness of cardiorenal therapies. 
					After my bachelors, I was supported in my research aspiration with a personal LUMC MD/PhD-scholarship (€154.000, top 1% students), allowing me to pursue a PhD before my clinical rotations (i.e. MSc Medicine). 
					After obtaining my PhD cum laude (2021), I received the Rubicon grant from NWO/ZonMw to expand my research with further postdoctoral training at the <a href="https://www.drugepi.org/">DoPE department</a> at Harvard University (2021-2023). 
					Currently, with support of a VENI grant I have returned to LUMC as a senior researcher, where I am also finishing my Medicine masters to become MD.
				</p>

				<h3>Research Area</h3>
				<p>
					My main research line focuses on answering pressing clinical questions in nephrology by combining innovative causal methods and large-scale healthcare data (in USA >200 million patients). 
					The main challenge in my research is to draw correct causal conclusions, since association is not causation. 
					For instance, I showed that the majority of studies on optimal dialysis timing used heavily flawed methods leading to incorrect conclusions (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34844936/">Fu et al. BMJ 2021</a>), with potential detrimental consequences for patient care. 
					To overcome these flaws, I pioneered the use of cutting-edge methods such as target trial emulation and the clone/censor/weight algorithm in the field of nephrology (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37131279/">Fu JASN 2023</a>). 
					This allowed me to obtain more reliable answers to important clinical questions on the effectiveness and safety of treatments. 
					Consequently, my research has directly impacted patient care by changing several international clinical practice guidelines and position statements (see <a href="../index.html#clinical-impact">this overview</a>). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, I've done research into the diagnosis and epidemiology of chronic kidney disease.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Backed by a VENI grant, I am currently extending my research to personalized medicine, by developing causal prediction models. 
					It's an exciting field: theory on estimating treatment benefits for individual patients is in its infancy but rapidly developing. 
					This has enormous potential to improve personalized medicine and lower healthcare costs by prescribing expensive medications only to those who will benefit, and thereby also minimizing side-effects. 
				</p>

				<h3>Teaching and educational activities</h3>
				<p>
					Besides informing clinical guidelines, I seek to improve the quality of clinical research by sharing my epidemiological knowledge. 
					For instance, I wrote educational articles to explain complex causal methods to clinicians (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37131279/">Fu JASN 2023</a>). 
					I was invited to give lectures to research groups around the world, including UCSF, Johns Hopkins, Harvard and UCL, and chaired two sessions during the largest European kidney congress (ERA 2023). 
					Furthermore, my expertise in causal inference is often requested in collaborations with other research groups. 
					I use Twitter as a platform to communicate my research to a broader audience and spark discussions, and as one of KNAW’s Faces of Science wrote blogs for a lay audience. 
					Lastly, I strive to provide targeted feedback to the community by serving as epidemiology editor for Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (invited position; youngest editor in history of journal), as peer reviewer (e.g. Kidney International, European Heart Journal), and until 2023 as editorial fellow at Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. 
				</p>

				<h3>Awards and grants</h3>
				<p>
					My work gained additional visibility through awards from various organizations, including “Best epidemiology article by a junior researcher” by the Dutch Epidemiology Society (2022; for the article <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34844936/">Fu et al. BMJ 2021</a>), “Best PhD Thesis in Nephrology” by the NFN/Nierstichting (2022), and Elsevier Weekblad’s “30 under 30” list (2022). 
					Lastly, I am honoured to have received the Stanley Shaldon Award (2023) from the European Renal Association “for the impact of his work on research and education in nephrology”. 
					It is the highest European distinction in nephrology for investigators less than 40 years, and at 26 years I am the youngest award winner to date. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I have received support from various grants throughout my research career, with a total of €874,386. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							A personal LUMC MD/PhD-scholarship allowed me to complete my PhD before my masters, and a Rubicon grant from NWO gave me the opportunity to go abroad and receive postdoctoral training at Harvard.
						</li>
						<li>
							I am now supervising my first PhD student with support of a personal €240.000-grant from the Nierstichting (2022).
						</li>
						<li>
							And the recent VENI grant allows me to venture into the new exciting field of personalized medicine.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>International network</h3>
				<p>
					I am grateful to have a strong international network consisting of experts in big data analysis, causal methods and nephrology. 
					I developed firm relations with PIs during my PhD at LUMC and Karolinska Institute (Friedo Dekker, Juan Jesus Carrero) and during my Postdoc at Harvard (Rishi Desai, Sebastian Schneeweiss).
					These researchers have large expertise in big data analytics and access to some of the highest quality datasets (Karolinska Institute) and largest datasets (Harvard) worldwide. 
					Being in Boston also allowed me to discuss new causal inference methods with their creators at Harvard (Miguel Hernan, James Robins), with a joint project under development. 
					Moreover, I wrote manuscripts on optimal estimation of kidney function (#6-7) with Andrew Levey and Josef Coresh - the developers of the CKD-EPI and MDRD equations (used worldwide to estimate kidney function) and of the kidney disease staging system.
